This is a simple implementation of a GPT language model. It's a naive attempt I made over a random 
weekend. It's a small language model dubbed **DumE**.
DumE is trained on a Wikipedia article about the origins of the Universe.
The original model is trained on a remote GPU in google Colab(training on a cpu is nerve-wrecking).

After completing it's training run, DumE said it's first words:
```

and out 20106 â€“ each last horizon as muched that the universe, and today is very emery nearly possible trans; and the oldn baryon matter; and through galaxies ward and quasars and galaxies (with as billion years.

The universe resumpirality
In a vistance of the age of the universe

```

It doesn't make sense, but the output is fairly good(in my opinion) given that I trained it for about 2 minutes 
on a dell laptop.
